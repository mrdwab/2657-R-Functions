# stringseed.sampling

The `stringseed.sampling` function is designed as a batch sampling function that allows the user to specify any alphanumeric input as the seed *per sample in the batch*.

## The Arguments

* `seedbase`: A vector of seeds to be used for sampling.
* `N`: The "population" from which to draw the sample.
* `n`: The desired number of samples.
* `write.output`: Logical. Should the output be written to a file? Defaults to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, a csv file is written with the sample "metadata", and a plain text file is written with the details of the resulting sample. The names of the files written are "`Sample frame generated on {date the script was run} .csv`" and "`Samples generated on {date the script was run} .txt`" and will be found in your current working directory.

## Examples

```{r stringseedsampling_example}
# Load the function!
require(RCurl)
baseURL = c("https://raw.github.com/mrdwab/2657-R-Functions/master/")
source(textConnection(getURL(paste0(baseURL, "scripts/stringseed.sampling.R"))))
# We'll use a data.frame with a list of village names, the population,
#   and the desired samples as our columns. The function will use the 
#   village names to generate a unique seed for each village before
#   drawing the sample.
myListOfPlaces <- data.frame(
  villageName = c("Melakkal", "Sholavandan", "T. Malaipatti"),
  population = c(120, 130, 140),
  requiredSample = c(30, 25, 12))
myListOfPlaces
stringseed.sampling(seedbase = myListOfPlaces$villageName,
                    N = myListOfPlaces$population,
                    n = myListOfPlaces$requiredSample)
# Manual verification of the samples generated for Melakkal village
#   (for which the automatically generated seed was 1331891848)
set.seed(1331891848)
sample(120, 30)

# What about using the function on a single input?
stringseed.sampling("Santa Barbara", 1920, 100)
```
