# stringseed.sampling

The `stringseed.sampling` function is designed as a batch sampling function that allows the user to specify any alphanumeric input as the seed *per sample in the batch*.

## The Arguments

* `seedbase`: A vector of seeds to be used for sampling.
* `N`: The "population" from which to draw the sample.
* `n`: The desired number of samples.
* `write.output`: Logical. Should the output be written to a file? Defaults to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, a csv file is written with the sample "metadata", and a plain text file is written with the details of the resulting sample.
